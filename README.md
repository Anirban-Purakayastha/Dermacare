- Dermacare is a web application aimed at providing individuals with a convenient and accessible tool for preliminary skin disease detection.
- It allows users to self-scan their skin, obtaining instant insights into potential skin conditions through a simple and user-friendly process.

# Tech Stack
- Dermacare is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. <br>
- MongoDB handles data storage, Express.js builds server-side APIs, Node.js powers the backend for efficient request handling, and React delivers a responsive and interactive front.
- Material UI library is used for designing the website.
- The Neural Network Model is made using TensorFlow in Python and is connected to the application using Flask.
